## EdgeMatcherClutter
Matching objects in image which contains also non-object (cluttered) edges.
### Description
Teaching the shape of a "golden" part with a lot of cluttering edges. Repetitive patterns are masked away from the teach region. Matching with identical objects and comparing results when background clutter is set to MEDIUM and HIGH respectively.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the app (F5) or debugging (F7+F10). Setting a breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after the 'Engine.OnStarted' event. Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage. Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page. 
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator in AppStudio 2.4.1 or higher can be used.
